Ember.js with Rails API backend experiment

This is my first attempt to create a project using a Ember.js front end, with a Rails API to power the backend.

The code was generated by following the tutorial at
http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/05/07/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-part-1.html

Todo:

1. Add Bootstrap for styling
2. Add additional fields to store image and video urls
3. Add slideshow functionality
